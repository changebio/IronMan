study non-promoter H3K4me3 in K562
1.genomic distribution in different cell lines(so I need their peaks by runing Macs under the same condition)

2.seperate peaks as promoter peaks and non-promoter peaks, look into their overlapping in different cell lines, respectively.

3. motifscan in non-promoter peaks to study the relationship between H3K4me3 and RACK7
